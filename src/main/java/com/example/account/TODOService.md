# Instructions
In the account package, you will need to design and create your own AccountService class from scratch.

- Your "AccountService" and should AT LEAST include the Stereotype annotation. 
- It is vital that you pay close attention to the naming convention given since the tests are looking for specific file names.
- Some of your Service methods may take slightly different input than the repository method which it calls (i.e. getting an object and only passing certain fields from that object
- Keep in mind that a properly constructed Repository has some built-in methods, such as save and find methods which can be leveraged.
- Business logic and validation should be included in your Service methods

You should refer to prior mini-project lab examples and course material for guidance.

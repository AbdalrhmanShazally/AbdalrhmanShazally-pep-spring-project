# Instructions
In the account package, you will need to design and create your own Service class from scratch.

- You should have an "AccountService" and should AT LEAST include the Stereotype annotation. 
- It is vital that you pay close attention to the naming convention given since the tests are looking for specific file names.

You should refer to prior mini-project lab examples and course material for guidance.

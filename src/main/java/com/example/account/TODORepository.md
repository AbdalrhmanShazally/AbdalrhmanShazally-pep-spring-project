# Instructions

In the account package, you will need to design and create your own AccountRepository interface from scratch.

- Your "AccountRepository" and should AT LEAST include the Stereotype Repository annotation as well as the @Query annotation.
- It is vital that you pay close attention to the naming convention given since the tests are looking for specific file names.
- Make sure that your account repository includes declrations for your 'login' method which accept String input for usernames and passwords.
- When searching for Messages by User, it will be helpful to also have a way to find if a user exists, either by Id or username

You should refer to prior mini-project lab examples and course material for guidance.

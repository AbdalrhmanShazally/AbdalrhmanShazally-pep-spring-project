# Instructions

In the account package, you will need to design and create your own Repository interface from scratch.

- You should have an "AccountRepository" and should AT LEAST include the Stereotype annotation as well as the @Query annotation.
- It is vital that you pay close attention to the naming convention given since the tests are looking for specific file names.
- Make sure that your account repository includes declrations for your 'login' and 'registerAccount' methods, which accept String input for usernames and passwords.

You should refer to prior mini-project lab examples and course material for guidance.

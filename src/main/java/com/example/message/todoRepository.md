# Instructions
In the message package, you will need to design and create your own Repository interface from scratch.

- You should have a "MessageRepository" and should AT LEAST include the Stereotype annotation as well as the @Query annotation.
- It is vital that you pay close attention to the naming convention given since the tests are looking for specific file names.
- Make sure that your message repository includes declarations for your 'newMessage', 'getAllMessages', 'getMessageByID', 'getMessageByAccount', 'updateMessage' and 'deleteMessage' methods.
- Include the appropriate annotations as needed for these methods.

You should refer to prior mini-project lab examples and course material for guidance.

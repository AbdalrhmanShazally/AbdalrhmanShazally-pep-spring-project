# Instructions
In the message package, you will need to design and create your own MessageRepository interface from scratch.

- Your "MessageRepository" and should AT LEAST include the Stereotype annotation as well as the @Query annotation.
- It is vital that you pay close attention to the naming convention given since the tests are looking for specific file names.
- Make sure that your message repository includes declarations for various CRUD operations (update, delete, get, etc...)
- Include the appropriate annotations as needed for these methods, some actions are Transactional

You should refer to prior mini-project lab examples and course material for guidance.

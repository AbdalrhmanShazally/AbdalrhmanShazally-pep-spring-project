/**
 * TODO: You will need to write your own endpoints and handlers for your controller using Spring. The endpoints you will need can be
 * found in readme.md as well as the test cases. You be required to use the @GET/POST/PUT/DELETE/etc Mapping annotations
 * where applicable as well as the @ResponseBody and @PathVariable annotations. You should
 * refer to prior mini-project labs and lecture materials for guidance on how a controller may be built.
 *
 * You are expected to have at least the following methods: getAllMessages, getMessageByID, getMessageByAccount, registerAccount, newMessage, login, deleteMessage.
 * 
 * These methods should follow proper naming conventions, and include appropriate arguments. Refer to the tests provided for more details.
